    # This is a strategy to test against multiple versions of Node.js
    # It ensures your package works for a wide range of users.
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]

    steps:
    # 1. Get the code from your repository
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Set up the specific version of Node.js
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm' # This speeds up installations

    # 3. Install all dependencies safely
    # 'npm ci' is recommended for CI as it's faster and safer than 'npm install'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci

    # 4. Build the project from TypeScript to JavaScript
    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    # 5. Run all the tests to ensure everything works
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
